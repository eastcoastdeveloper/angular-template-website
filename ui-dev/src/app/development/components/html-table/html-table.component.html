  Let's begin with the markup, which is shockingly simple.
  <ul>
    <li>Add the title and input field inside of a parent wrapper.</li>
    <li>Do the same for the headers.</li>
    <li>Create an empty section for the body content</li>
  </ul>

    The JavaScript is far more complex. If you're seeking a static table in
    html, there's plenty of resources for that.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Get the search field followed by the caret&mdash;which is currently non
        existent. We're gonna add it dynamically. That's the purpose of this
        line here: caret != undefined ? caret.remove() : ''; sortColumn fn takes
        says, "If the caret is not undefined, do something. Otherwise, do
        nothing.
      </li>
      <li>body gets the body class. This is where we inject the HTML.</li>
      <li>
        filterType retrieves the name of the clicked column to use it for how
        it's filtered.
      </li>
      <li>
        filtered is an array used to reorganize table rows, when filtered.
      </li>
      <li>data is the incoming JSON, and markup is the actual HTML.</li>
      <li>str is the input field value</li>
      <li>
        The first block is a key-up listener on the search field. It rearranges
        the data by looping over an array of objects, then repopulates the
        table.
      </li>
      <li>
        To repopulate the data, markup and the body innerHTML are set to empty.
        We then populate the table, and set the innerHTML to the new order.
      </li>
      <li>
        comparison fn is a fancy way of comparing the key values with one
        another. Then reordering them.
      </li>
      <li>
        sortColumn fn does a number of things. One such item is it destroys and
        recreates the caret. We run the populateTable fn again.
      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        The last block imports the JSON: ({"id": 1, "title": "iPhone 9",
        "price": 549, "brand": "Apple", "category": "smartphones"}).
      </li> -->
    </ul>

    There's a million ways to do this. This was my first attempt at the
    challenge without a framework. Using one would no doubt be a time saver, but
    I digress. Play around with the code
