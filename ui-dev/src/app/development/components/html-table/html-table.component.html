  This JSON powered table in HTML is search and sortable. Nimble enough to plug
  right into an array of projects. There's an onslaught of additional features
  that can be added here, but I think this's a good foundation. With the current
  setup we could add pagination and/or expandable rows. Just to name a few.
</p>

<h2>Bare Bones Markup</h2>
<ul class="project-list">
  <li>Add the title (h4) and input field inside of a parent wrapper.</li>
  <li>Create the headers nested inside of parent tags as well.</li>
  <li>
    Create an empty section for the body content with class 'body'. This is
    where the table content will be injected.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="code-preview element-margin-top">
  <pre><code>{{ markup }}</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="image-wrapper element-shadow element-margin-top">
  <img
    [src]="htmlTableProjectImage"
    alt="Basic table with title, five columns, and a searchbar"
  />
</div>

<h2>Table in HTML Script</h2>
<ul class="project-list">
  <li>
    The first variable gets all the first child divs of parent elements with
    header class.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get the search field followed by the caret&mdash;which is currently non
    existent. We're gonna add it dynamically. That's the purpose of caret !=
    undefined ? caret.remove() : ''; in the sortColumn fn. sortColumn says, "If
    the caret is not undefined, remove it. Otherwise, do nothing.
  </li>
  <li>
    The body variable represents the body class (table body). This is where we
    inject the HTML.
  </li>
  <li>
    filterType retrieves the name of the clicked column to use it for how it's
    filtered.
  </li>
  <li>filtered is an array used to reorganize table rows, when filtered.</li>
  <li>data is the incoming JSON, and markup is the actual HTML.</li>
  <li>str is the input field value</li>
  <li>
    The first block is a key-up listener on the search field. It rearranges the
    data by looping over an array of objects, then repopulates the table.
  </li>
  <li>
    To repopulate the data, markup and the body innerHTML are set to empty. We
    then populate the table, and set the innerHTML to the new order.
  </li>
  <li>
    The comparison fn is a fancy way of comparing the key values with one
    another. Then reordering them.
  </li>
  <li>
    The sortColumn fn does a number of things. One such item is it destroys and
    recreates the caret. We run the populateTable fn again.
  </li>
  <li>The last block imports the JSON.</li>
</ul>

<div class="code-preview element-margin-top">
  <pre><code>{{typescript}}</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Style the Table</h2>
<p class="project-text">
  Styling is fairly straightforward. Certainly nothing overly complex. I will
  say however, if you think it's easy, try and coding it yourself. A lot of devs
  say CSS is a breeze or literally despise writing it. My experience is many
  devs really don't know how to write CSS&mdash;even at a basic level. Lots of
  people rely on libraries like Bootstrap for columns, but don't know how to
  work with absolutes, flex, and grid. I've seen senior devs who can't build a
  three column layout. So, regardless of how easy it may look, put the same
  effort into learning CSS and Sass as you would with TypeScript, Spring, or any
  other technology.

<div class="code-preview element-margin-top">
  <pre><code>{{style}}</code></pre>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="project-text">
  You may be thinking, why would I build this in 2023? Beginner devs often know
  frameworks like React, but don't know HTML, CSS, or the basics or JavaScript.
  Some may say JavaScript is dead, but it's undoubtedly the backbone of
  TypeScript. JSX is akin to TypeScript in that it's written with JavaScript
  support and both compile to thereof. So, if you know JSX or TypeScript but not
  JavaScript, you're limited.

  In conclusion, this is one method of developing something natively. Something
  that can otherwise be written faster and easier with a framework. Anywho,
  check out the code. Try and make it your own. Hope you enjoyed this brief
