  Sometimes I'm amazed how much developers can accomplish in such few lines of
  code. No frameworks or libraries, just code in a native language. I think this
  is one of those times. Here's a neat component, done so with minimal code.
  Begin by setting the variables.
</p>

<ul class="project-list element-margin-top">
  <li>
    Basic date reference followed by the current time, denoted via
    this.date.getTime().
  </li>
  <li>targetDate is of course the desired date to countdown from.</li>
  <li>targetTime is the numeric version of the date.</li>
  <li>difference is then subtracted by now (numerically).</li>
  <li>
    The months array is used to illustrate the month name in the template. Feel
    free to substitute this w/ template literals.

    >
  </li>
  <li>
    We're using basic ViewChild to retrieve the DOM elements, which are then
    populated w/ values.
  </li>
  <li>
    ngAfterViewInit is used because ViewChild elements do not become available
    at early life cycle hooks.
  </li>
  <li>
    The isNaN bit is pertinent because days is NaN before it's calculated. So
    unless you want NaN showing in the UI, use the ternary.
  </li>
  <li>
    In this hook, we call a repeating fn every 1 second. It updates the
    difference bwtween then and now and divides it by a series to make it
    readable/presentable.
  </li>
  <li>
    tickTock() creates a new date, and updates the aforementioned values. That's
    it!
  </li>
</ul>

  Ideas for additional features may include a millisecond count down too. Or
  perhaps the ability to change the time zone, in turn updating the time.
  Regardless, customize it to suit your needs. As always, if you get stuck or
  need a working version, check out my
