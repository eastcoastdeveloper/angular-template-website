  I used in page navigation frequently while working at a former company. The
  owners often didn't want new pages for different sections. They didn't even
  want parameters appended to the url. Such as ?section=2. The result was to
  create unique methods of showing/ hiding content. This project is one such
  concept. Yes, it may be more cumbersome than the aforementioned, but
  development sometimes calls for creative solutions.

    *ngFor="let item of [].constructor(sectionLength); let i = index"
    [ngClass]="{ 'display-none': currentSection != i }"
  >
    <div #sections>
      {{ 'Section ' + (i + 1) }}
      <div *ngIf="currentSection === 0" class="section-content">

  In the TypeScript file below, we retrieve a group of elements. @ViewChildren
  is akin to document.getElementsByClassName. Though it no doubt has many other
  uses. We retrieve the third line of the HTML, denoted by the "#sections"
  reference. Necessary to show & hide them. Next, btnGroup references the group
  of buttons.
</p>

<p class="project-text element-margin-top">
  This is a very dynamic component. Component in that we could simply pass the
  section count and inject HTML for the content. bar references the progress
  bar. currentSection for the only visible section. The progress array holds the
  percentage divs.
</p>

<p class="project-text element-margin-top">
  Math is used to round the percentages. In turn a Math object is needed.
  Created in the constructor. Notice the first line of the ngAfterViewInit
  block. ChangeDetection is used because the values are changed during runtime
  compilation. The length of the bar is set here too. Also in the
  ngAfterViewInit hook grid columns are set, indicative of how many sections
  there are. Set by the sectionLength variable. Yes, set any number of sections,
  and an equal amount of buttons and sections render.
</p>

<p class="project-text element-margin-top">
  The navigate fn sets the currentSection and the progress bar width. show &
  hideProgressBar functions adjust the bar opacity and height.

  The markup below loops over an empty array. We use the constructor keyword to
  initialize the object and pass it the amount of sections. Hiding all but the
  current section via display none. ngIf unfortunately cannot be used on the
  same line as Angular restricts one template binding per element. Add the
  section headline. The progress bar equation is a clever way of accommodating
  any number. I'd imagine 2, 3, 4, or 5 is ideal. All of which work beautfully
  with this line. Divide 100 by the amount of sections. Round that number. Then
  multiple it by the section indice.

  I initially thought section content could be housed in a JSON file, but that's
  far too messy. We always want to create sustainable systems. Using a separate
  file for the content would definitely work. We could even remove the 'Section
  1' and include that in that section content. Form groups would work here.
  Images, endpoints, etc. Whatever you decide to do, go for it. Angular is an
  immensely powerful framework with the ability to do nearly anything imaginable
  in the UI. Fork and customize. Make this in page navigation component your
  own!
