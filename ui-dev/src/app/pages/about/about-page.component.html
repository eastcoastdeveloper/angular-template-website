            In 2006 I began advertising my services as a rookie graphic designer
            on Craigslist. Twelve years later I was working on a cutting edge
            SaaS product for the United States Senate. From 2018 - 2021 I was a
            Sr. UI Developer on Capitol Hill. I currently work remotely for one
            of the nation's largest banks.

            My contracting experience with literally hundreds of companies has
            taught me a variety of things. One in particular &mdash; how to get
            things done. I've always taken the initiative. I've built a
            reputation for over delivering. Someone that plans and is very
            systematic. It's the programmer mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            Taking the initiative has also led me on a path of discovery.
            Knowing who to ask for missing pieces. Then following those leads as
            far as they go. Collaborating with a variety of developers and
            stakeholders; with a thorough understanding of the development and
            design process, I always have questions. Questions that enhance team
            discussion and meeting participation.

            I've made leaps and bounds over the years. Graphic design to motion
            graphics. Static web pages and massive interactive ad campaigns to
            single page applications. CMS solutions to data driven UIs with
            hundreds of components&mdash;all communicating with one another.
            Now, I write unit tests, work with Spring, Node JS, and Mongo. I'm
            inching into pipelines, Docker, and Kubernetes.

            Beyond work, I make time to do what I love. Photography, traveling,
            and spending time outdoors. I enjoy cruising around Newport and
            Huntington Beach on my silent but quick, electric scooter. I post my
            photos on
            <a

            and always thinking about my next travel adventure.

              Aside from my day job as a developer, I'm currently working on two
              books. Both are which are slated for publication this year. Topics
              range from software to security.

              I'm well on my way to creating a MEAN stack application with a

              While working in government (2018 - 2021), I began using NVD3, D3,
              and ChartJS. My job often called for me to build dynamic graphs
              using a variety of libraries. All of which needed to be heavily
              customized to match the mocks. In my spare time

              All of which have garnered hundreds of forks.

              Circa 2019, after reading an onslaught of technology books, I
              started a blog. I write about Aritifical Intelligence, Online
              Privacy & Security, coupled with Technology's Impact on Our World.
